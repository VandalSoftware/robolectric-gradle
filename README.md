Robolectric Gradle Plugin
=========================

This project was adapted from [Pivotal Labs' project](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric-gradle-plugin).

## Key Differences

- Robolectric tests live separately from `androidTest`, which means they can run independently from tests created for the Android testing framework

For example, you can run the `test` task by itself or alongside `connectedCheck`:

```
$ ./gradlew test
$ ./gradlew test connectedCheck
```

## Setup

Apply the plugin:

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.vandalsoftware.tools.gradle:robolectric:0.3.0'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'robolectric'
```

Tests are placed in the same directory as you would normally place them if you were applying the `java` plugin.

```
src/
  main/
  test/
  testFlavor/
```

## Configuration

Use the `testCompile` configuration to customize dependencies:

```
dependencies {
  testCompile 'com.example:example:1.0'
}
```

By default, the plugin adds Robolectric and JUnit JARs. Use the `testCompile` configuration to select specific versions:

```
dependencies {
  testCompile 'junit:junit:4.11'
  testCompile 'org.robolectric:robolectric:2.+'
}
```

### Flavor configuration

```
testPaidCompile 'junit:junit:3.8'
```

### Test task configuration

The `RobolectricExtension` allows you to configure default includes and excludes; and includes and excludes by build type and product flavor:

```
robolectric {
    include '**/Foo*.class'
    
    buildTypes {
        debug {
            include '**/Bar*.class'
        }
    }
    
    productFlavors {
        free {
            exclude '**/PaidTest*.class'
        }
    }
}
```

This configures `robolectricTestFreeDebug` task to include `[**/Foo*.class, **/Bar*.class]` and exclude `[**/PaidTest*.class]`

Alternatively, you may want to configure the Test task directly. Tasks prefixed with `robolectricTest*` are [Test](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html) tasks and can be configured as such:

```
project.afterEvaluate {
  project.robolectricTestDebug {
    // set a system property for the test JVM(s)
    systemProperty 'some.prop', 'value'

    // explicitly include or exclude tests
    include 'org/foo/**'
    exclude 'org/boo/**'

    // set heap size for the test JVM(s)
    minHeapSize = "128m"
    maxHeapSize = "512m"

    // set JVM arguments for the test JVM(s)
    jvmArgs '-XX:MaxPermSize=256m'
  }
}
```
